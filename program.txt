Algorithm for problem:
Q (n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10!    is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27. Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!)

Algorithm

STEP 1 :
Finding the factorial:
1. Initialize the result to be 1
2. If number < 1 then return 1 else goto step 3
3. Loop to the number and multiply each number to the given input number
4. return the result.

STEP 2:
Finding the Sum of digit in a number
1. Initialize the sum to be zero
2. Unitl the final digit is obtained add the individual digits
3. Digit is obtained by modulus diviion by 10 & correspoing next number is obtained by dividing by 10
4. Return the Sum

Test:
For the example number 10! = sum is 27
For the number 100! result is 659
